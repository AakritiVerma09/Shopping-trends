# Shopping-trends
This project aims to analyze customer shopping trends through a detailed dataset that captures various factors influencing purchasing decisions. By examining customer demographics (age, gender, location), purchasing behavior (items bought, purchase amount, frequency), payment methods, and preferences such as shipping types and discounts, the project seeks to uncover patterns and preferences in consumer behavior.

Key insights include the impact of seasonality on purchasing choices (e.g., winter clothing vs. spring items), payment preferences (credit card vs. PayPal), and the frequency of purchases based on product category and customer age. The project also explores the role of promotional strategies such as discount applications and promo codes in influencing consumer decisions.

Through this analysis, retailers can gain valuable insights into optimizing product offerings, targeting promotions effectively, and improving customer experience through tailored payment and shipping options.
